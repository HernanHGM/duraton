<h1> duraton </h1>
This repository stores all of my projects related to birds preservation. The Durat√≥n is a river in my hometown, Segovia, where vultures abound, being an icon of nature.
Currently there are three projects: "sexaje", "huesos" and "geolocalizacion",.


<h3> sexaje </h3>
It aims to create a model for each specie that can classify the sex of each bird by its biometric measures. 
Nowadays the model for harpy eagle is finished and published on huggingface: "https://huggingface.co/spaces/hernanhgm/Sexaje_por_biometria"
The rest of the models are coming soon.

<h3> huesos </h3>
"huesos" follows the idea of "sexaje", trying to create a model that identifies the species to which the skeletal remains found in nature belong. 
In this case instead of giving the model numerical data it will be given a picture of the bones. 
For now we are working on classifying the skulls of golden and imperial eagles. 
Later it will be extended to other bones and species. Once the models reach sufficient accuracy, they will be uploaded to Hugging face.

<h3> geolocalizacion </h3>
Here is contained the code I am using to study the movements of tagged eagles in order to understand their routines, behavior and interactions.
